Project: Aged Trial Balance (ATB) – RCM Analytics

Domain: US Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)
Tool Stack:Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Compliance:HIPAA Safe (real patient data not published)

Objective

To analyze Aged Trial Balance (ATB) data and identify revenue leakage, overdue AR, payer-wise risk, and collection efficiency using automated Python pipelines.

-- Business Questions Answered by This Project

1. What is the total outstanding AR balance of the practice?
2. What is the average Days in AR across all patient accounts?
3. What percentage of AR lies in the 120+ days overdue bucket?
4. Which insurance payer contributes the highest AR risk?
5. Which department generates the maximum outstanding balance?
6. What is the Net Collection Ratio (Payments ÷ Fees)?
7. What is the monthly billing and AR trend?
8. Which top 10 patient accounts hold the highest AR balances?
9. How is AR distributed across aging buckets (0-30, 31-60, etc.)?
10. How do Fees, Payments, Adjustments and Refunds compare?
